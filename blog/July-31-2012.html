    	<h1 class="header">Website Revamp</h1>
        <h2 class="dateP">July 31, 2012</h2>
        
        	<p class="para">I thought I would quickly cover the process I went through while redesigning my website. The whole effort took just under a week (including the learning process), and I went from knowing almost no HTML/CSS to a reasonable amount.</p>
            <p class="para">Below is a picture of the old homepage:</p>
            <center>
            <img src="../images/oldindex.jpg" width="700" height="525">
            </center>
            <p class="para"></p>
            <p class="para">The homepage was actually an image I had created (in photoshop), which was then spliced and imported into a HTML document. I then used the property tab to link the cutouts of the headings to their respective pages, all without touching any of the code! Subsequent pages were built, with all of the styling being done in the HTML itself, no style sheets (I remember I was quite fond of the center tag). Most of them were actually images that I added titles to and used the hotlink creator to draw clickable areas over the text.</p>
            <p class="para">My original site worked fine for a few months. I was busy with college and didn’t really have the time or drive to work on my website so I just let it be. However, I soon began to see the need for a more professional and useful website and decided it was time for a revamp.</p>
            <p class="para">I started on YouTube by watching a bunch of Dreamweaver CS5 tutorials from a user called createthenet, whom I would like to give a lot of credit to for such wonderful tutorials. I watched the first 20 or so which gave me a great foundation in CSS for my own website. I didn’t really like the slideshow plugin that was used in the video so I found a different one called Elastic Image Slideshow and made that the centerpiece of my media pages. This, along with the s3slider used for the projects page, were both jQuery plugins.</p>
            <p class="para">I also knew that I wanted to have a contact form that could redirect mail to an address of my choice (forwarding costs extra from godaddy). I found a simple tutorial online that included a php validation script, which I happily included.</p>
            <p class="para">The rest of the pages were made using templates created from the home page, with all of the styling being done in CSS. I’m quite happy with the layout and will probably keep it for the foreseeable future.</p>
            <p class="para">If you have any questions feel free to get in touch.</p>
