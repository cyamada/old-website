/* ~~ These are the columns for the layout. ~~ 

1) Padding is only placed on the top and/or bottom of the divs. The elements within these divs have padding on their sides. This saves you from any "box model math". Keep in mind, if you add any side padding or border to the div itself, it will be added to the width you define to create the *total* width. You may also choose to remove the padding on the element in the div and place a second div within it with no width and the padding necessary for your design. You may also choose to remove the padding on the element in the div and place a second div within it with no width and the padding necessary for your design.

2) No margin has been given to the columns since they are all floated. If you must add margin, avoid placing it on the side you're floating toward (for example: a right margin on a div set to float right). Many times, padding can be used instead. For divs where this rule must be broken, you should add a "display:inline" declaration to the div's rule to tame a bug where some versions of Internet Explorer double the margin.

3) Since classes can be used multiple times in a document (and an element can also have multiple classes applied), the columns have been assigned class names instead of IDs. For example, two sidebar divs could be stacked if necessary. These can very easily be changed to IDs if that's your preference, as long as you'll only be using them once per document.

4) If you prefer your nav on the right instead of the left, simply float these columns the opposite direction (all right instead of all left) and they'll render in reverse order. There's no need to move the divs around in the HTML source.

    <h1>My &quot;Start Here&quot; Arduino Robot</h1>
    </center>
    <p>The following is the arduino-based version of the &quot;start here&quot; robot. This project was started after working with the PICAXE platform for several months, and is the start of my transition to ATmega microcontrollers.</p>
  <h2>The Build</h2>
    <p>The build is basically the same as the PICAXE-based bot, except that the chassis and attachments are a little more refined. The base is made out of shapelock, with holes drilled out in order to mount the motors. Everything else is attached with either hot glue or the solitary rubber band holding the arduino and protoshield on top of the battery pack. </p>

    </center>
    <h3>The Program</h3>
    <p>The code for this robot was exactly the same in design as the PICAXE bot, except written in wiring. While I originally thought I preferred the BS2 environment, I eventually made the switch to ATmegas and the arduino because the syntax better  reflected modern programming langauges.</p>
